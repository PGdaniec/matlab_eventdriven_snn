# eventDrivenSpike
event driven spiking network in matlab based on Engelken Paper

This repo is based mainly on https://github.com/RainerEngelken/reanalysis. It was just implemented out of curiosity for spiking neural networks. The implementation consists of some experiments. It is a port of the original code to Matlab and extended to be used with arbitrary inputs. The code is not optimized for speed and is not intended to be used in production. It is just a proof of concept.
